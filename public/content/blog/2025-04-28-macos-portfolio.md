# Building a macOS-inspired Portfolio with React

_Posted on April 28, 2025_

## The Inspiration

When designing my portfolio, I wanted something that would stand out from typical portfolio websites while showcasing my React skills. Inspired by the clean, intuitive design of macOS, I decided to create a desktop-like experience right in the browser.

## Technical Implementation

### Window System

The most challenging aspect was implementing a window system that behaves like the real thing. This required:

- Creating draggable and resizable windows with react-rnd
- Implementing minimize/maximize animations with Framer Motion
- Managing window state with Zustand
- Handling z-index for proper window stacking

```jsx
// Example of window state management
const useWindowsStore = create((set) => ({
  openWindows: [],
  openWindow: (id, title, component, position, size) => {
    // Implementation
  },
  closeWindow: (id) => {
    // Implementation
  },
  // Other actions
}));
```

### Dock Implementation

The dock was created using Framer Motion for smooth animations. Each icon scales up when hovered and bounces slightly when clicked.

## Lessons Learned

This project taught me a lot about advanced animation techniques and state management. I also gained experience with:

- CSS Grid for layout
- Managing complex component hierarchies
- Performance optimization for animations

## Conclusion

Building this portfolio was both challenging and rewarding. The final result is not just a showcase of my projects, but also a demonstration of my ability to create complex, interactive interfaces.

Next time, I plan to add more features like a virtual file system and terminal application to make the experience even more immersive.
